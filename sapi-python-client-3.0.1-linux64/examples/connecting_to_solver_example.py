#	This example shows how display local/remote solver properties as well as to use the solver to
#	asynchronously solve an ising problem by using async_solve_ising function. It also shows how
#	to cancel a submitted problem by using the cancel() function.
#
# usage:
#  1. list all solver names of local connection
#     connecting_to_solver

#  2. list solver properties of local connection and solve problem
#     connecting_to_solver solver_name

#  3. list all solver names of remote connection
#     connecting_to_solver url token

#  4. list all solver properties of remote connection and solve problem
#     connecting_to_solver url token solver_name
